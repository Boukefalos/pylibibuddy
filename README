Description:
Instead of using your i-buddy (http://www.i-buddy.com) with MSN Messenger, why not use it to show other info?
With pybuddy, you can control your i-buddy to do any of the supported actions: change head color, blink its 
heart, beat its wings, etc. Example uses are: monitoring a website traffic (404s in red, 500s beating wings, 
200s in green), showing your project's continuous integration process, ...and so on.

Dependencies:
The daemon is written in python, runs on Linux and needs python-usb. To install on Debian, use
`apt-get install python-usb`; on RedHat, `yum install pyusb`. (Or `easy_install python-usb`?)

Software using pybuddy:
    Beside the scripts published in the contrib directory, there is other software using pybuddy:
    * Jabbim (http://jabbim.cz/), a Jabber/XMPP client that mimics i-buddy MSN Messenger behaviour
    * AMSN-iBuddy (http://github.com/frangor/amsn-iBuddy/blob/master), an AMSN plugin

Other versions:
    * pybuddy-dx (http://code.google.com/p/pybuddy-dx/) if you own a DX (DealExtreme) ebuddy

Forked from Google Code's SVN at http://code.google.com/p/pybuddy/

Working on a non-daemon version (currently "my_pybuddy.py") and library that can be used elsewhere...
